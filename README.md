For this Group Project we wanted to solve those age old bickering sessions where people argue over movie facts. We want a factual way t settle those arguments using code.

We used the OMDB API to pull all the movie facts for each movie searched. We then used the YouTube API to pull the top three movie trailers of the movies searched. 

Both used AJAX calls to pull data from the web.
